This project is an AI-based model that can detect whether a news article is fake or real using machine learning.

What You Need
Python Installed (Recommended version 3.8 or later)

Required Libraries (Install them later):
pandas

numpy

sklearn

flask

Step-by-Step Setup
1. Get the Project
Download or clone the repository from GitHub.

Open the folder where the project is saved.

2. Set Up the Environment
Create a separate Python environment to keep the project organized.

Activate the environment before running the project.

3. Install Required Libraries
Install the necessary dependencies so that the project can run smoothly.

4. Run the Application
Start the model and let it process the data.

5. Open the Web App
Use a web browser to access the interface and enter news text.

6. Use the Model
Type or upload a news article.

Click the Predict button.

The model will analyze the input and classify the news as Fake or Real.

7. (Optional) Train the Model Again
If needed, you can retrain the model using the provided datasets (Fake.csv and True.csv).

8. Close the Environment After Use
If you used a virtual environment, deactivate it when youâ€™re done.

Important Notes
Keep the required files (fake_news_model.pkl and vectorizer.pkl) in the same folder as the main script.

If the web app does not start, double-check that all required libraries are installed correctly.
